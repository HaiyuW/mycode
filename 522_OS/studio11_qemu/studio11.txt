As the result shows, it takes about 1 minutes and 13 seconds to boot the VM.

When booting the VM, we waited about 10 minutes, but the QEMU console window didn't show anything, while the load of CPU was very high. We can infer that the VM was being booted but it could take a very time to boot it without the certain command.
We can get the conclusion that KVM can accelerate the speed of booting the VM because KVM is based on the kernel while without KVM, the virtualizaion is based on hardware. Thus, KVM can reduced a large amount of codes to be executed when booting the VM, which means KVM can accelerate the process of booting the VM.
