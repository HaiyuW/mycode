2. Results as following:

pi@raspberrypi-why:~/test_programs $ ./dense_mm 1000
Generating matrices...
Multiplying matrices...
^C
pi@raspberrypi-why:~/test_programs $

As it shows, the program printed "Generating matrices..." and 
"Multiplying matrices...". However, I tapped CTRL+C, and then 
the program was interrupted and didn't print "Multiplication done!"
This means I interrupted the program successfully.

3. Results as following:

pi@raspberrypi-why:~/test_programs $ ./dense_handler 500
Generating matrices...
Multiplying matrices...
^C receive a SIGINT 2
^C receive a SIGINT 2
^C receive a SIGINT 2
^C receive a SIGINT 2
^C receive a SIGINT 2
Multiplication done!
SIGINT times: 5

Everytime when I pressed CTRL+C, it first called back ^C and 
print "receive a SIGINT 2". The number "2" is the parameter 
entering the function handler(). At the end of the results, it shows
the SIGINT times are 5.

4. Results as following:

pi@raspberrypi-why:~/test_programs $ ./print5000

1162 was possibly interrupted
2140 was possibly interrupted
2997 was possibly interrupted
3780 was possibly interrupted
4862 was possibly interrupted

This program printed out 5000 numbers and at the end of the
outputs it documented 5 places where I pressed CTRL+C. The 
processes at these places may be interrupted by the signals.
It didn't show any problems happening, the outputs are still 
correct.
However, since printf() are not safe within a handler, it may
make some problems using this function

Note: I omit some results like "i: XXX", since there are too many 
outputs and the lines are too long.

5. Results as following:

pi@raspberrypi-why:~/test_programs $ ./densew 500
Generating matrices...
Multiplying matrices...
^C handler called
^C handler called
^C handler called
^C handler called
Multiplication done!
SIGINT times: 4

As it shows, my handler() function print "handler called"
everytime when I pressed CTRL+C, and at the end ,the total 
number of SIGINT is 4.
The write function can guarantee to be safe when called from
a handler, so there will be no problem

pi@raspberrypi-why:~/test_programs $ ./printw
i: 1
i: 2
i: 3
i: 4

1163 was possibly interrupted
2149 was possibly interrupted
3125 was possibly interrupted
4046 was possibly interrupted
4931 was possibly interrupted

Each time I pressed CTRL+C, the program printed the message 
"handler called". At the end of outputs, the program printed 
the places where I printed CTRL+C
The write function can guarantee to be safe when called from
a handler, so there will be no problem

Note: Also, I omit some results
